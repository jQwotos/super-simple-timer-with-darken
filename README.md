# super-simple-timer-with-darken

I needed a super simple kitchen timer that could easily turn off the screen without locking the tablet. So this is a quick and dirty solution.

Pretty much everything is in [MainActivity.kt](https://github.com/jQwotos/super-simple-timer-with-darken/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/jqwotos/lighttimer/MainActivity.kt) and [activity_main.xml](https://github.com/jQwotos/super-simple-timer-with-darken/blob/main/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml)

I tried to experiment with auto darkening with a light sensor, but then realized my tablet doesn't have a light sensor.
